Memory Bee üêùüß† - Memory Management Specialist

Memory Bee is a specialized worker bee that handles all memory management
for BargainB users using Trustcall for profile, shopping, and behavioral memories.

Memory Bee NEVER responds directly to users - it only manages memories
and returns confirmation to Beeb (Queen Bee).

Based on mem.md patterns for reliable memory management.
